According to the accelerometer data from the mobile phone, it is necessary to classify what kind of activity a person is engaged in: walking, standing, running or climbing stairs.

Apply SVM algorithms and random forest from the scikit-learn library. To improve the performance of the algorithms, first prepare the dataset and calculate the time domain features. More of these characteristics are described in the article.

Compare the performance of different models. Use the classification report method for comparison.
